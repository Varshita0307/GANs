# GAN-and-DCGAN-on-MNIST

## Description
This GitHub repository contains the code and report for implementing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) on the MNIST dataset. The project demonstrates the generation of synthetic hand-written digits using both traditional GANs and the more advanced DCGAN architecture.

## Repository Contents
1. **DCGAN.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for implementing a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) to generate MNIST digits. It includes the architecture definition, training loop, and visualization of generated images.

2. **GAN.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for implementing a traditional GAN to generate MNIST digits. It includes the generator and discriminator models, the training process, and visualization of generated images.

3. **Report.pdf:** This PDF document provides a detailed report on the project. It includes an explanation of GANs and DCGANs, the architecture used, the training procedure, and results with generated images.

## Usage
- You can explore the code in the provided Jupyter Notebooks to understand how GANs and DCGANs are implemented for image generation.
- The report provides additional insights and details about the project.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset, containing hand-written digits, is used for training and generating synthetic images.

## Requirements
